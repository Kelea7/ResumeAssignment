        <h1>Kiara Lea MOS, CSM, LSSBB, CLS</h1>
        <h2>Business Owner and Customer Service Associate</h2>

        <p>As a full time business owner, employee, student and mom, I feel there is nothing I can't do. Owning my own business 
          has really allowed me to embrace skills that can transfer over to school and work. I can read and write reports while 
          applying analytical skills. I dare to be innovative and creative, bringing new ideas to help improve a process. I can 
          design for different events and also help plan them. Being a mother helps to navigate multitasking skills.
          As a mother, you have to wear many hats. This can be incorportated in how I am as an employee. I have always had a passion 
          for learning which has led me to always going above and beyond at any job.
